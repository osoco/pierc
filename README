This is a fork of Pierc to try to adapt it to read logs from an Openfire database. Only the log browser is useful in this case, so the bot isn't included.

Installation
============

Required packages for Debian:
 * mysql-server
 * apache2
 * php5
 * php5-mysql
 * libapache2-mod-php5

git clone https://github.com/osoco/pierc.git into a directory served by apache (/var/www for example).
Copy the file config.php.example to config.php and edit it. You'll need to set the database connection variables at least.
With a standard apache configuration you should then be able to open http://localhost/web/pierc/index.php to see the log.


Original project README:

Pierc is a python bot that logs IRC channels, and a PHP/JS interface for browsing said logs.

Installation instructions can be found at http://classam.github.com/pierc/ . 

It depends on python-mysql and Joel Rosdahl's IRC Bot library, both of which are ~GPLv2 - so
Pierc, too, is GPLv2.
