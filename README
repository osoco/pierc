This fork is under development and is not yet usable. It is a fork of Pierc to try to adapt it to read logs from an Openfire database. Only the log browser is useful in this case, so we will remove the bot.

Original project README:

Pierc is a python bot that logs IRC channels, and a PHP/JS interface for browsing said logs.

Installation instructions can be found at http://classam.github.com/pierc/ . 

It depends on python-mysql and Joel Rosdahl's IRC Bot library, both of which are ~GPLv2 - so
Pierc, too, is GPLv2.
